Anime-Night

Anime Movie Night 

The purpose of this project is for a user to be able to find quick and simple information about anime movies in order to make easy, fast and informed 
choices for an anime movie night (we've all at some point experienced a movie scrolling night instead of a movie watching night because it can be hard to 
make decisions)! 

The end result will look like this:
